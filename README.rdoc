## Sample application to fool with data from Draft

Run these commands to try it out.

  bundle
  rake db:setup
  OAUTH_ID=... OAUTH_SECRET=... rails s -p 3001

Requires Ruby 1.9.2 or later to run.

This is based on the [TODO example from RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/episodes/353-oauth-with-doorkeeper).

Your OAuth Redirect URI that you would setup in Draft for this app would then be something like this: 

http://127.0.0.1:3001/auth/draft/callback
